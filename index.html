    <p>I like learning something that I'm passionate about. I've been wanting to build professional websites ever since I was 17, I'm 27 now.</p>
 
  
  
    <h2> JavaScript </h2>
    <p>I'm learning Javascript to program a working website and to display any links or images correctly. Coming into this program, I knew a little about JavaScript, I knew that all web browsers use it and it lets the user edit the website as they feel fit. I like doing JavaScript because it's easier to use and someone with basic knowledge of JavaScript would be able to use it.</p>
  
  
 
    <h3><p style="color:lime;">CSS</p></h3>
    <p>I'm learning CSS, as well, to change the color of a text, background, or highlight something. I know that it uses XML markup language to function properly. It is mainly used to bring attention to the user to something, such as an important event. This is my favorite part of the course because I like to mess around with all the different colors and see what looks appealing to me and what color would catch other people's attention while they are reading something on a webpage.
  
  
  
    <h4>HTML</h4>
    <p> I'm learning HTML to display a list, image, or a data table in a website. I knew nothing about HTML except what it stood for, which is HyperText Markup Language. What I like about HTML is that when you put a list in, it automatically adds bullets, making it more organized and makes it easier to read on the webpage. </p>
    
    A website I frequently visit is: <a href="www.youtube.com"> YouTube </a>
